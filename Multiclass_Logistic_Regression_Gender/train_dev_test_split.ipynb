    "In this script, I first split the CCNC (Comprehensive Chinese Name Corpus) into train/dev/test sets based on the ratio of 8:1:1, which translates into 2926487: 365811: 365811 in terms of sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "As only the first names will be used to train the logistic regression model, both the train set and dev set are then deduplicated based on first names and gender (so that the model can be more efficiently trained). This process reduces the size of train set from 2926487 to 633857, and the size of dev set from 365811 to 167528. The finally saved train/dev sets only contain first names and related genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the test set, the full names and related genders are instead saved and it is thus deduplicated based on full names and gender (if I do it for first name + gender, the sample will be reduced from 365811 to 167849). The full names are saved because there will be a rule-based filter to retrieve the first names from given names and I want to test whether that works well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in actuality, the ratio among the train/dev/test sets is 633857: 167528: 167849, which roughly equals to 6: 2: 2."
